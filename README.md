PSI-09 is a savage, sarcastic AI roastmaster deployed as a Flask-based API and connected to WhatsApp via automation tools like WhatsAuto or AutoResponder. It uses OpenAI's GPT model (`gpt-4o-mini`) to deliver brutal, witty comebacks — all with memory per phone number for context-aware replies.

- The Flask app binds to `0.0.0.0` and uses port `5000` or whatever Render assigns.
- Uses URL query params so it's easy to call from WhatsAuto, browser, curl, etc.
- No need for JSON headers or body in WhatsAuto.
